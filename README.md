#GraphvizWrapper - Simple Swift Wrapper for macOS around the Graphviz library

This is a simple framework for Xcode in order to be able to use the Graphviz library in any Swift program. 

* Current Graphviz library version: **1.36**
* Licence for wrapper: **Not decided yet, EPL expected**

Help needed in order update the project to use a later Graphviz version and/orto create a cocoapods version.
